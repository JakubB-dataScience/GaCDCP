## The run_analysis.R script does the job by dividing it into several steps.

## 1. First, the data is downloaded and unpacked in a folder called UCI HAR Dataset.

## 2. In the next step, data is assigned to variables.
  'features' <- features.txt
  'activities' <- activity_labels.txt
  'subject_test' <- test/subject_test.txt
  'x_test' <- test/X_test.txt
  'y_test' <- test/y_test.txt
  'subject_train' <- test/subject_train.txt
  'x_train' <- test/X_train.txt
  'y_train' <- test/y_train.txt
  
## 3. Then the data sets are combined into one data set.
  'X' - created by merging 'x_train' and 'x_test' by rbind() function
  'Y' - created by merging 'y_train' and 'y_test' by rbind() function
  'subject' - created by merging subject_train and subject_test by rbind() function
  'merged' - created by merging 'Subject', 'Y' and 'X' uby cbind() function

## 4. The next step is to calculate the mean and standard deviation.
  'tity' - created by subsetting merged, (selected only: subject, code and the measurements columns) and calculated the mean and standard deviation

## 5. Change the names in the dataset to descriptive
  In 'tidy' dataset replaced column names with descriptive

## 6. Marks a data set with descriptive variable names
  code column in 'tidy' renamed into activities
  'Acc' name replaced by 'Accelerometer'
  'Gyro' name replaced by 'Gyroscope'
  'BodyBody' name replaced by 'Body'
  'Mag' name replaced by 'Magnitude'
  name start with character 'f' replaced by 'Frequency'
  name start with character 't' replaced by 'Time'

## 7. Saving the Data Frame to a text file
  Export 'ready' into 'ready.txt'
